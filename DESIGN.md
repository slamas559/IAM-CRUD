## 📃 2. One-Page Design Doc

# Design Summary – CRUD IAM Dashboard Backend

## 🏗 Frameworks & Libraries

- **Express.js** – simple, lightweight backend framework
- **TypeScript** – ensures safety, maintainability
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** – flexible schema with strong typing
- **JWT** – stateless authentication
- **Joi** – robust input validation
- **Jest + Supertest** – for reliable testing

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt**
- Tokens are signed using **JWT with expiration**
- Inputs are validated with **Joi** to avoid injection
- Access is guarded by **JWT middleware** and **RBAC**

---

## 🛠 Production Readiness

- ✅ Proper folder structure
- ✅ Environment variable support via `.env`
- 🧪 Tested endpoints
- 🛡 Secure password/token handling

---

## 🧩 How to Extend This in Production

- Add **rate limiting**, **audit logging**, and **monitoring** (e.g., with `winston`, `morgan`, or ELK)
- Integrate **OAuth2**, **MFA**, or **SSO**
- Containerize with **Docker**
- Add **SAST/DAST scans** via CI/CD (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk)
- Support pagination, filtering, and sorting for lists
